Additionally, we offer a Tampermonkey script — [**ChatGPT Shortcut Anywhere**](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/482907-chatgpt-shortcut-anywhere), which allows users to customize matching domain names and use the AiShort sidebar on any website. However, due to script content injection limitations on ChatGPT pages, the sidebar function of the script is activated via a popup on ChatGPT pages.
