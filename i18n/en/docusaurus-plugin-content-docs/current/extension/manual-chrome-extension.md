After successful installation, check the [Plugin Usage Tutorial](./usage.md).

## Installation Issues?

1. Windows users: Check if you have unzipped the downloaded installation package (instead of double-clicking to open)?

2. Is "Developer mode" enabled? If not, refer to step 2.

3. Did you drag the crx file into the "Extensions" page? Note ⚠️: Do not click "Load unpacked", you must drag the crx file.

4. Browser doesn't allow installing crx files? Try installing the zip file! [Click here for zip installation tutorial](./manual-chrome-extension-zip.md).
