3. Did you drag the crx file to the "Extensions" page? Note⚠️: Do not click [Load unzipped extension], you must drag in the crx file.

4. The browser does not allow the crx file to be installed? Try installing the zip file! [Click here to view the zip installation instructions](./manual-chrome-extension-zip.md).
