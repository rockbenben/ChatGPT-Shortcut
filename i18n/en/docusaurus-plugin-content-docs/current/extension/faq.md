# Extension FAQ

## ChatGPT Page Restrictions

ChatGPT has set multiple permission restrictions on pages embedded in extensions, so logging in with Google authorization is not supported. This means users must log in using a username and password.

If your account was originally created via Google authorization, you can use the "Forgot Password" function to set a new password. This ensures you can log in smoothly within the embedded ChatGPT page.

## Content Blocked Prompt

After logging in with username and password, the page may sometimes show a "Content is blocked" prompt. In this case, usually a simple **refresh of the page** will solve the problem and restore the page to a normal logged-in state. Furthermore, once logged in, unless you actively log out, the login status usually stays for a long time, so you don't need to worry too much about frequent appearance of such prompts.

Note that switching languages within the integrated ChatGPT page may also trigger the "Content is blocked" prompt. Therefore, it is recommended that you switch languages through the extension's settings rather than directly within the integrated page. This avoids unnecessary error prompts.
