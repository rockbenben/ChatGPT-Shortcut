# Extension Usage Issues

## ChatGPT Embedded Page Limitations

ChatGPT imposes several access restrictions on its embedded extension pages, notably the lack of support for Google account authorization for login. This means that users must log in using their username and password.

If your account was initially created through Google authorization, you can use the "Forget Password" feature to set a new password. Doing so will ensure that you can successfully log in to the ChatGPT embedded page.

## Content Blockage Notice

After logging in with a username and password, you might occasionally encounter a notification stating "This content is blocked." In such instances, simply reloading the page is often sufficient to resolve the issue and revert the page back to its normal state post-login.

It's important to note that switching languages within the integrated ChatGPT page might also trigger the "This content is blocked" notice. Therefore, I recommend changing languages through the extension's settings rather than directly on the integrated page. This approach can help avoid unnecessary error messages.
