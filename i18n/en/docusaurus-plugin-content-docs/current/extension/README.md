# Install Browser Extension

The AiShort (ChatGPT Shortcut) extension helps you access the AiShort prompt library anytime to enhance your work and study efficiency. It supports major browsers like Chrome, Edge, and Firefox, and features a sidebar that can be quickly summoned with the shortcut `Alt + Shift + S`.

## ðŸ§© Tampermonkey Userscript

In addition to the browser extension, we also offer the [**ChatGPT Shortcut Anywhere Userscript**](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/482907-chatgpt-shortcut-anywhere).
Tampermonkey is a browser extension that allows users to run custom scripts to enhance webpage functionality.

With this script, you can bring up the AiShort sidebar on any website.
However, please note that due to script injection restrictions on the official ChatGPT page, the script will run as a **pop-up window** instead of a sidebar on that specific page.
