# How to use the browser extension?

ChatGPT Shortcut supports 13 mainstream languages, and the extension language will be automatically set according to your browser environment. The language of ChatGPT built-in page and sidebar in the extension will also follow this setting. Please note, to avoid triggering permission alerts of third-party websites, avoid directly changing the language in embedded pages.

## Display Settings

### AiShort Sidebar

After enabling the AiShort sidebar, you will see a green icon switch at the bottom right corner of the supported web pages. By clicking this icon, you can toggle the sidebar on or off. Currently, it defaults to support ChatGPT, Bard, Claude, and Wenxin Yiyan. If you choose to "Activate sidebar automatically," the sidebar will open automatically when you visit these supported sites.

If you want to use the AiShort sidebar on other websites, please install the [ChatGPT Shortcut Anywhere](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/482907-chatgpt-shortcut-anywhere) script. Please note, to avoid overlapping functionalities and potential conflicts, the ChatGPT Shortcut Anywhere script will not be effective on websites natively supported by the extension.

### Built-in Homepage

After enabling the built-in homepage feature, a button for the built-in page will appear in the top left corner of the ChatGPT web version. Clicking it will replace the ChatGPT app interface with the AiShort page.

## Separate Window Mode

When separate window mode is enabled, the extension interface will persistently appear in a separate window, facilitating multitasking. You can set websites for automatic activation in the extension settings. When the browser visits these sites, the AiShort window will automatically activate.
