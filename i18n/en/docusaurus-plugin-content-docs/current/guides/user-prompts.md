## Delete Prompt

Click the "Delete" button in the edit interface to delete the prompt. Deletion cannot be undone, please operate with caution.

## Share to Community

When creating or editing a prompt, check the "Share to Community" option:

- **Public**: The prompt will be displayed on the community page, and other users can see and collect it
- **Private**: Visible only to yourself, will not appear on the community page

You can modify the sharing status at any time.

## Export Backup

Export all prompts created by you:

1. Enter User Center
2. Click "Export Prompts" button
3. The system generates a JSON file and automatically downloads it

Export content includes:

- Prompt title, description, remark
- Creation and update time
- Sharing status

It is recommended to export backups regularly to prevent data loss.

## Import Prompts

Import prompts and favorites from a JSON file:

1. Enter User Center
2. Click "Import Prompts" button
3. Select a JSON file
4. The system automatically merges data

### Team Collaboration

Recommended workflow for sharing prompts within a team:

1. **Filter & Share**: After exporting data, manually remove your favorites or filter specific prompts, then share the file with team members for import
2. **Privacy Protection**: Prompts imported from others (whose IDs don't belong to your account) are automatically set to **Private**, ensuring data isolation between members
