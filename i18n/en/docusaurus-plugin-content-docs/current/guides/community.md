# Community Prompts

The Community Prompts section displays custom prompts shared by users. You can find inspiration here or share your own creativity.

## Sorting and Filtering

The community page provides multiple filtering methods:

- **Publish Time**: View the latest shared prompts
- **Vote Sorting**: View prompts with the most upvotes
- **Keyword Search**: Search for prompts on specific topics

## Voting Mechanism

Decide the exposure of prompts by upvoting/downvoting:

- **Upvote**: Help high-quality content get more exposure
- **Downvote**: After the number of downvotes reaches a certain amount, the prompt will be hidden

**Collection Link**: When collecting a community prompt, the system will automatically cast an upvote.

> Voting is only open to logged-in users, and each person's vote for the same prompt is based on the most recent one.

## Private Prompts

Creativity you don't want to make public can be set to private:

- When creating or editing a prompt, uncheck the "Share to Community" option
- Private prompts are only visible to yourself
- You can switch between public/private status at any time
