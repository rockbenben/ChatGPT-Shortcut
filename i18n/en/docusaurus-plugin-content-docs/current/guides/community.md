# Community Prompts

The Community Prompts section showcases custom prompts shared and uploaded by our users. This section is designed to encourage the exchange of creative ideas and spark inspiration, allowing every user to find new ideas and share their own unique creations. You can not only share your prompts on the public page but also browse prompts shared by others to gain inspiration.

## Sorting and Voting

The Community Prompts page offers multiple options for users to freely filter and find prompts, including sorting by publication date, upvote/downvote ranking, and keyword search.

The upvote/downvote mechanism is a crucial way to determine which prompts are displayed on the main page. This system aims to enhance content quality and relevance by allowing users to directly participate in filtering out prompts the community finds valuable. For prompts that are considered low-quality, you can **express your disapproval by downvoting**. Once a prompt receives a certain number of downvotes, it will be hidden from the public page to ensure that only high-quality content is displayed.

The voting feature is only available to logged-in users to ensure the authenticity and validity of the votes. Each user's vote on a single prompt will be based on their most recent choice, ensuring that the results accurately reflect the current opinions of the users.

## Private Prompts

If you have ideas or prompts that you don't wish to make public, the community also offers the option of private prompts. When submitting or updating a prompt, you can choose whether or not to share it with the community. This way, you can save your prompts privately and share them when you are ready to exchange inspiration with others.

We sincerely invite you to actively share your creative prompts and help maintain the high quality of community content through the upvote/downvote mechanism. Every participation and contribution you make is a key force driving the continuous growth and improvement of the community. Let's work together to create a prompt community environment that is creative, vibrant, and mutually supportive.
