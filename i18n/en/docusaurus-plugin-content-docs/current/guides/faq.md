# FAQ

## Why use prompts in English?

AI models generally have better understanding of English, and using English prompts can yield more stable output results.

Although using Chinese prompts can get decent results, repeated input of the same Chinese prompt may lead to significant variations in results. Therefore, it is recommended to use English prompts in important scenarios.

**Specify Chinese Reply**: Add `respond in Chinese` at the end of the prompt to get a reply in Chinese.

## Do I need to enter the prompt every time?

**API Use**: You can set the prompt as "system prompt", which will be automatically applied to subsequent conversations.

**Web Version**: If you haven't switched topics, ChatGPT will remember the current conversation's prompt settings. When the reply starts to deviate from expectations, it means the AI has "forgotten" the prompt, and you need to re-enter it.

**Tip**: Save frequently used conversations as bookmarks for quick access later.

## What if AI outputs false information?

AI sometimes "hallucinates", outputting information that seems plausible but is actually incorrect. Suggestions for use:

1. **Verify Key Information**: Especially data, citations, code, etc.
2. **Multi-round Optimization**: Let AI check and optimize the answer again.
3. **Cross-verification**: Use different prompts or models to verify important conclusions.

Appropriate prompts can help you reduce the occurrence of AI hallucinations.

## How to back up my prompts?

1. Enter User Center
2. Click "Export Prompts" button
3. The system automatically generates a JSON file for download

It is recommended to back up regularly to prevent data loss.

## Prompt results are not ideal?

1. **Try Optimization**: Let AI optimize the answer again.
2. **Change Perspective**: Use different prompts to express the same requirement.
3. **Feedback & Share**: If you find problems or have good prompts, welcome to inform us via [Feedback](/feedback) or share in the community.
