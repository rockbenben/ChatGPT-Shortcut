# My Collection

After logging in, you can collect your favorite prompts and manage them personally. The My Collection view provides rich management functions to help you efficiently organize and use prompts.

## View Switching

The top of the homepage provides view switching buttons, supporting two modes:

- **My Collection**: Displays your collected prompts and custom prompts
- **Prompt Library**: Browse the public prompt library to discover new content

The browser will automatically remember your view selection and switch to the last view upon your next visit.
