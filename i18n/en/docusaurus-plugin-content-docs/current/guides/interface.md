## 🏷︎ Tag Filtering

The tag area facilitates users to filter prompts based on domain and function.

Via the "Tag Filter Rule Switch" button at the top right, you can achieve more precise multi-tag filtering:

- **OR Rule** (Default): Show prompts that have any of the selected tags
- **AND Rule**: Only show prompts that have all selected tags simultaneously

## 🔍 Keyword Search

Keyword search function supports searching for prompt titles, descriptions, and content.

- If tags are already selected, the search scope is limited to those tags
- After logging in, the search scope includes your collections and custom prompts
