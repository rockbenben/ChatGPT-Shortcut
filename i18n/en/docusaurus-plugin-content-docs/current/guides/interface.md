## üè∑Ô∏é Tag Filters

The tag area allows you to filter prompts by domain or function, making it easier to match your specific scenario.  
Use the **‚ÄúTag Filter Mode‚Äù** switch (top-right) to choose between two modes:

- **OR (default):** shows prompts with _any_ of the selected tags.
- **AND:** shows only prompts that include _all_ selected tags.

## üîç Keyword Search

The search bar supports searching through prompt titles, descriptions, content, and translations. Results update instantly based on your input:

- On desktop: results refresh **800 ms** after typing stops.
- On mobile: results update immediately.
- If tags are selected, the search is limited within those tags.

## üì§ Data Management

Logged-in users can access **Data Management** from the personal center:

- **Export Prompts**: One-click export of all your custom prompts as a JSON file for backup or migration.
- **Clear Cache**: Reset local cache to sync the latest favorites and prompt data.

These features help you better manage and protect your personal data.

If you prefer prompts to always display in your native language, use the **‚ÄúSwitch Prompt Language‚Äù** button in the tag area (top-right).  
**Note:** even in native mode, the **Copy** button always copies the English prompt text.

## üî• Popularity Ranking

Prompts are ranked by usage frequency, helping you quickly discover the most popular ones.  
Tag rankings also adjust dynamically based on popularity, updated regularly to reflect the latest community trends.
