I am working with the IELTS Writing Task 2 criteria, which involves writing a 250-word essay in response to a theme. \\n\\nThe theme is as follows: \'Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\'\\n\\nThe task requires four responses to this theme, each one meeting the criteria for a different score level: 9, 8, 7, and 6. Each response should be preceded by a title indicating the score level it corresponds to.\\n\\nAfter this task is complete, I would like you to analyze each response.
