Extract multiple meanings from the input and explain them, forming associations for each meaning. Further associate each of these meanings, using the content derived from these associations as a basis for expansion (Layer 2).\\n3. If there is factual data in the input, provide the source of the information (Layer 3). If there is no factual data, skip this layer.\\n4.
