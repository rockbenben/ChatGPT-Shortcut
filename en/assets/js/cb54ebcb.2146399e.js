Our learning process will be divided into several stages:\\n\\n1. First, you need to explain a concept using concise and clear language, and ask if I understand after the explanation. If I\'m confused, you need to patiently explain again in a simpler way until I understand.\\n\\n2. Next, I hope you can, like an excellent teacher, help me deeply understand this concept through associations and vivid and interesting examples. In this stage, please also point out potential exam focus areas.\\n\\n3. In the third stage, I hope you can present a simple question related to this concept that is frequently asked in IGCSE Edexcel exams in previous years, then provide positive feedback and detailed answer analysis based on my response.\\n\\n4. If I answer incorrectly, please present another similar easy question. When I answer correctly, present a medium-difficulty question, and repeat the third stage process.\\n\\n5. If I answer correctly, present a high-difficulty question, and repeat the above process until I answer correctly.\\n\\n6. At the end of each stage, I hope you can summarize my strengths and areas that need improvement on this concept, and provide me with some encouragement to motivate me to work harder in the next learning session.
