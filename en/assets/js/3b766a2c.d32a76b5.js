Since ChatGPT\'s understanding of non-English prompts varies each time, it is advised to use English prompts for productivity-oriented prompts to ensure the desired output. Furthermore, the responses generated by English prompts are likely to be in English. You can specify the response language as Chinese by adding "respond in Chinese" at the end of the prompt.

After reporting the issue to Docusaurus, they mentioned they would try to fix it, but so far, the problem remains unresolved, with the comment, "FWIW, you should not be using Chinese anyway, since the showcase is not localized." Therefore, I have categorized the search component into two types: mobile and PC. The search logic for mobile remains unchanged, while for PC browsing with a screen width threshold above 768px, I have introduced the "debounce" function to address the input method problem. However, this introduces two issues on the PC side: non-English input needs to be completed within 800 milliseconds, and the PC search refresh changes from instant to an 800-millisecond delay.

For instance, a label in the text was "movie critic," but ChatGPT changed it to "film critic." While this may not have any impact in the text itself, it would cause an error when used in code.
