## 4. Termination

AiShort may, in its sole discretion, terminate or suspend your access to the Services, without notice, for any reason, including but not limited to, breach of these Terms. Upon termination, all rights granted to you under these Terms will immediately cease. AiShort will not be liable to you or any third party for termination of your access to the Services.

## 5. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability

The Services are provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, AiShort disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. AiShort does not warrant that the Services will meet your requirements or that the Services will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free.

In no event shall AiShort, its affiliates, or their respective officers, directors, employees, or agents be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to, loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of, or your inability to access or use, the Services, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory.

## 6. Changes to Terms

AiShort may modify these Terms at any time and in its sole discretion. If we make changes to these Terms, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page. By continuing to access or use our Services after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you must stop using the Services.

## 7. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction where AiShort is located, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes arising from or relating to these Terms or the Services shall be resolved through good faith negotiations between the parties. If such negotiations fail to resolve the dispute, the parties agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration under the rules of the applicable arbitration organization, with the prevailing party entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.

## 8. Miscellaneous

If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of AiShort to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by AiShort without restriction. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and AiShort concerning the Services and supersede and replace any prior agreements between you and AiShort with respect to the Services.
