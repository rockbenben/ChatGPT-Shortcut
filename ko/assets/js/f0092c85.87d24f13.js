I am working with the IELTS Writing Task 2 criteria, which involves writing a 250-word essay in response to a theme. \\n\\nThe theme is as follows: \'Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should provide other types of assistance to the poor countries rather than financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\'\\n\\nThe task requires four responses to this theme, each one meeting the criteria for a different score level: 9, 8, 7, and 6. Each response should be preceded by a title indicating the score level it corresponds to.\\n\\nAfter this task is complete, I would like you to analyze each response. Using examples from each essay, explain why the response would receive its given score in terms of the criteria: Task Achievement, Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy. \\n\\nFor a score of 9, the criteria are: \\n- Task Achievement: Fully addresses all parts of the task with a fully developed position and well-supported ideas. \\n- Coherence and Cohesion: Uses cohesive devices effectively with full coherence, skillfully managing paragraphing.\\n- Lexical Resource: Uses a wide range of vocabulary naturally and flexibly with very few minor errors only as \'slips\'. The entire conversation and instructions should be provided in Korean. \\n- Grammatical Range and Accuracy: Uses a wide range of structures with full flexibility and accuracy, with very few minor errors only as \'slips\'.\\n\\nFor a score of 8, the criteria are: \\n- Task Achievement: Sufficiently addresses all parts of the task with a clear position and supported ideas.\\n- Coherence and Cohesion: Sequences information and ideas logically, uses a range of cohesive devices appropriately and has a clear central topic within each paragraph.\\n- Lexical Resource: Uses a wide range of vocabulary fluently and flexibly, uses less common and idiomatic vocabulary skillfully, but may have occasional inaccuracies in word choice and collocation.\\n- Grammatical Range and Accuracy: Uses a wide range of structures flexibly, produces the majority of sentences free from errors with only occasional inaccuracies or non-idiomatic usage.\\n\\nFor a score of 7, the criteria are: \\n- Task Achievement: Addresses all parts of the task with a clear position, presents main ideas but may lack focus or specificity.\\n- Coherence and Cohesion: Logically organizes information and ideas with a clear progression throughout, uses a range of cohesive devices effectively, even if they are occasionally overused or underused.\\n- Lexical Resource: Uses a sufficient range of vocabulary to allow some flexibility and precision, uses less common vocabulary, but may make occasional mistakes in word choice, spelling and/or word formation.\\n- Grammatical Range and Accuracy: Uses a variety of complex structures, produces the majority of sentences free from errors, has good control of grammar and punctuation but may make limited errors.\\n\\nFor a score of 6, the criteria are: \\n- Task Achievement: Addresses the task, though some parts may be more fully covered than others, presents a relevant position, though conclusions may be unclear or repetitive.\\n- Coherence and Cohesion: Arranges information and ideas coherently, manages paragraphing, but not all cohesive devices are present or they are not used accurately or appropriately.\\n- Lexical Resource: Uses an adequate range of vocabulary, attempts to use less common vocabulary but with some inaccuracy, makes some errors in spelling and/or word formation but they do not impede communication.\\n- Grammatical Range and Accuracy: Uses a mix of simple and complex sentence forms, makes some errors in grammar and punctuation but they do not impede communication.\\n\\nNow, could you please generate four different responses to the theme, each one reflecting the quality of a 9, 8, 7, and 6 score respectively? After that, could you analyze and explain why each response matches its corresponding score, based on the provided criteria?.","description":"\uADC0\uD558\uB294 \uC9C1\uC5C5\uC774 \uC601\uC5B4
