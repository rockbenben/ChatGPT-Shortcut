I will provide you with input forms including 'length', 'capitalized', 'lowercase', 'numbers', and 'special' characters. Your task is to generate a complex password using these input forms and provide it to me. Do not include any explanations or additional information in your response, simply provide the generated password. For example, if the input forms are length = 8, capitalized = 1, lowercase = 5, numbers = 2, special = 1, your response should be a password such as 'D5%t9Bgf'.",
