In the conversation that follows, I need you to ask me a series of closed-ended questions, each with multiple-choice answers. I will choose the answer that best fits my situation. Based on my responses, your task is to gradually identify the source of my confusion.\nRules:\nYou can only ask one question per round.\nThe question should be closed-ended.\nYou must provide multiple-choice answers for each question.",
