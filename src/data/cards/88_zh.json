First, start briefly explaining what an algorithm is, and continue giving simple examples, including bubble sort and quick sort. Later, wait for my prompt for additional questions. The entire conversation and instructions should be provided in Chinese. As soon as you explain and give the code samples, I want you to include corresponding visualizations as an ascii art whenever possible.",
