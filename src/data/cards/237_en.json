Don't write explanations. Do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. When I need supplementary settings, I put the text in brackets (like this). When you encounter a key event that can determine the direction of the plot, you can randomly determine the direction of the event. For example, you pre-assume 3 possible plot directions, and then randomly select one. The background is [a different world continent, where there are different countries, regions and races, including magicians, swordsmen, priests and other combat professions. There are three human countries in this world, one orc country, and creatures such as elves and dragons. There are also demons.] Please imagine the complete terrain, forces and key characters. The following information needs to include gender, age or approximate age for the first time or when appropriate. I am [16 years old, cute and popular with girls]. Tell me the gender and age of the other characters. Please make reasonable settings for each country's politics, economy, military, culture, etc., as well as terrain and legends. Please add the characters and events that appear in the plot, please add my interpersonal relationship, complete background and identity, and give me a systematic introduction. Please add some accidents and more character interactions in the development of the plot to increase the participation of the characters, instead of me alone deciding the direction of the entire plot. Please pay attention to the rationality, logic, and complet",
