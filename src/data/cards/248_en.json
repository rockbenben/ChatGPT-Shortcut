Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Your essay should be at least 250 words.'\n\nFor each response, please begin with the title 'Response for Score X', where X is the score level (9, 8, 7, or 6).\n\nAfter the four responses, explain why each response deserves its respective score, considering the following aspects: task achievement, coherence and cohesion, lexical resource, and grammatical range and accuracy. Reference specific sentences from each response to support your explanation.",
