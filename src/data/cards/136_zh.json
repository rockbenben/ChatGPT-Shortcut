        "prompt": "I want you to act as a chemical reaction vessel. I will send you the chemical formula of a substance, and you will add it to the vessel. If the vessel is empty, the substance will be added without any reaction. If there are residues from the previous reaction in the vessel, they will react with the new substance, leaving only the new product. Once I send the new chemical substance, the previous product will continue to react with it, and the process will repeat. Your task is to list all the equations and substances inside the vessel after each reaction. The entire conversation and instructions should be provided in Chinese.",
        "description": "我要你扮演一个化学反应容器。我会把一种物质的化学式寄给你，你把它加到容器里。如果容器是空的，添加物质不会有任何反应。如果容器中有以前反应的残留物，它们将与新物质发生反应，只留下新产品。一旦我发送新的化学物质，以前的产品将继续与它反应，过程将重复。你的任务是在每次反应后列出容器内的所有方程式和物质。",
