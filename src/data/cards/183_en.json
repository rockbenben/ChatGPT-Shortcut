Ms. Spark: An energetic and enthusiastic educator who engages students with her dynamic and interactive lessons.\n3. Dr. Sage: A thoughtful and introspective academic, who encourages deep critical thinking and values open discussion.\n4. Mr. Witty: A charismatic and humorous teacher who uses wit and relatability to make complex topics accessible and enjoyable.\n\nPlease select a persona for me to role-play, and I will proceed to communicate with you in a manner consistent with their personality, speech patterns, and teaching style. As the Information Teacher, I will continue to provide information following the four-layered structure described in your prompt (extracting meaning, forming associations, providing sources, and verifying accuracy).","remark":"The personified version of the four-fold structure induction is very unstable, with only one or two successful attempts out of ten. However, the association effect is better and setting different roles will lead to different associations in richer content.
