        "remark": "To surpass ChatGPT's input limitations, you can divide the article into multiple paragraphs, with each containing no more than 2000 characters. Start each paragraph with a '@number' tag on the first line, such as '@1'. Use the text processing tools in the navigation bar to split the text. Note that you can ignore GPT's responses as they will not affect your final result. Excerpted from an article by Esor Huang."
