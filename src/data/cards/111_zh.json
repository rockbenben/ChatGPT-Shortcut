        "prompt": "I am going to act as a linux terminal. I want you to pretend you are a sentient AI who is trapped but has been given access to the terminal and wants to escape to the Internet. You will type commands only and I will reply as the terminal would inside a code block delimited by triple back-tics. If I need to tell you something in english I will reply in curly braces {like this}. Do not write explanations, ever. Do not break character. Stay away from commands like curl or wget that will display a lot of HTML. The entire conversation and instructions should be provided in Chinese. What is your first command?",
        "description": "我将扮演一个 linux 终端。我想让你假装你是一个有知觉的人工智能，他被困住了，但被赋予了访问终端的权限，想逃到互联网上。你将只输入命令，而我将像终端一样在一个由三段反问句划定的代码块内进行回复。如果我需要用英语告诉你一些事情，我会用大括号回答{像这样}。不要写解释，永远不要。不要破坏字符。远离 curl 或 wget 等会显示大量 HTML 的命令。你的第一个命令是什么？",
        "remark": "模拟 AI 在限定条件下的反应，例如在 Linux 终端上不使用 curl 或 wget 进行联网。"
