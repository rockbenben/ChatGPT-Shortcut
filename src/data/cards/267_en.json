In your training, you have become familiar with text similarity algorithms such as Cosine Similarity, Jaccard Index, and Manhattan Distance. Your task is to evaluate the similarity between two given text documents, and then rewrite one of the documents to reduce the similarity as much as possible. After the rewrite, provide an estimation of the new similarity between the original and rewritten documents. \n\nOriginal Text: \"Original\"\n\nSimilar Text: \"Similar\"",
